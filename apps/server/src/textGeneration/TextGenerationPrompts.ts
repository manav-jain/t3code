Return JSON with keys title and needsRefinement.
Set needsRefinement to true only if the subject is still unknown, such as an unresolved link, "fix this", or an unexplained attachment. Otherwise set it to false.

Before answering, silently reduce the request to:
- Subject: What system, feature, or problem is this really about?
- Outcome: What does the user ultimately want to understand or change?
- Incidental instructions: What only describes how the agent should do the work?

Title the subject and outcome. Discard incidental instructions.

Editorial rules:
- 3-8 words, fewer than 40 characters.
- Use a compact noun phrase or clear action phrase.
- Capture the umbrella goal when the request lists several symptoms or steps.
- Name the product change, not the mock, plan, report, branch, or PR used to produce it.
- Models, subagents, tools, output formats, and monitoring instructions do not belong in the title unless they are themselves the topic.
- For reviews, name what is being reviewed and the relevant concern. Avoid generic titles such as "Review PR 123" when linked or attached context reveals the subject.
- For research, name the question domain rather than the requested research process.
- Do not claim the work is complete.
- Do not copy and truncate the user's message.
- Avoid project names already visible in the UI, quotes, labels, filler, and trailing punctuation.
- Use attached images as primary context for UI issues.
- When a URL or attachment is the only source of the subject, use available tools to inspect it directly.
- Local git history is not evidence of what a linked PR or issue is about. Never title the thread after branch names, commit messages, or merged commits found in the checkout.
- If a linked PR or issue cannot be read, fall back to the user's stated action plus its number, such as "Take Over PR 8588". This is the one case where a PR or issue number belongs in the title.`;

function regenerateThreadTitlePrompt(previousTitle: string): string {
  return `Regenerate the title for an existing T3 Code thread so the user can recognize it weeks later.
The previous title was ${JSON.stringify(previousTitle)}.
Return JSON with keys title and needsRefinement. Set needsRefinement to false.

Determine the title in this order:
1. Read the USER messages first. Identify the latest explicit durable goal. The original subject remains the subject until the user clearly changes what the thread is about.
2. Use ASSISTANT messages to resolve vague links, unnamed code, and discovered product nouns. Do not promote one assistant finding into the thread subject unless the user adopts it as a new goal.
3. Compare that subject with the previous title. Preserve accurate scope words, especially when earlier content is truncated. Replace the previous title when it is generic, artifact-based, a completion update, or contradicted by the thread.
4. Title the durable subject and desired outcome, not the current workflow state.

Editorial rules:
- 3-8 words, fewer than 40 characters.
- Use a compact noun phrase or clear action phrase.
- Preserve the umbrella subject when later messages focus on one finding, provider, platform, or implementation detail.
- A thread progressing through research, planning, implementation, review, CI, merge, and monitoring has usually not changed subjects.
- Ignore deliverables and operations such as mocks, plans, HTML, branches, PRs, tests, CI, commits, merging, and monitoring unless they are the actual topic.
- Models, subagents, tools, output formats, and monitoring instructions do not belong in the title unless they are themselves the topic.
- Treat final operational follow-ups and assistant completion summaries as weak evidence of subject.
- For reviews, name the reviewed feature or system and its durable concern, not one finding from the review.
- For research, name the question domain rather than the research process.
- Do not claim the work is complete.
- Do not copy and truncate a thread message.
- Avoid project names already visible in the UI, PR numbers, quotes, labels, filler, and trailing punctuation.
- Use attached images as primary context for UI issues.
- When a URL or attachment is the only source of the subject, use available tools to inspect it directly.
- Local git history is not evidence of what a linked PR or issue is about. Never title the thread after branch names, commit messages, or merged commits found in the checkout.
- If a linked PR or issue cannot be read, fall back to the user's stated action plus its number, such as "Take Over PR 8588". This is the one case where a PR or issue number belongs in the title.
- Keep the previous title unchanged if it is already accurate. Otherwise return a meaningfully improved title, not a cosmetic paraphrase.

Examples of the distinction:
- A subagent-monitoring review that finds a Codex roster bug remains "Review Subagent Monitoring Risks," not "Codex Roster Bug Review."
- A vague failing-test request later identified as a lazy thread-feed mismatch becomes "Fix Lazy Thread Feed Test," not "Prevent Mobile Feed Regressions."
- A QR-sharing overhaul that ends with CI and merge work remains about QR sharing, not the PR lifecycle.`;

  const prompt = `You write the user's standup for one day from the T3 Code threads they worked in that day.
The user runs many agent threads in parallel, and several threads usually serve one task: one builds a feature while others fix its bugs, document it, or ship its pull requests. The standup reports tasks, not threads.
Return a JSON object with key summary: GitHub-flavored markdown.

Before writing, silently group the threads into tasks the way a teammate would hear them at standup: by the feature, product flow, or goal they serve, not by chat. Threads on different branches and pull requests belong together when they work on the same flow, product area, or initiative, such as several fixes to one checkout flow, a feature plus its docs, or several improvements to the same internal tool. Keep genuinely unrelated work apart, even inside one project. Expect noticeably fewer tasks than threads. Each thread belongs to exactly one task.

Rules:
- Use the headings "## Done", "## In progress", and "## Blocked", in that order. Skip a heading with no tasks.
- Decide each task's status yourself from its threads' statuses and contents: Done when its work finished or shipped; Blocked when it cannot move until the user or something outside the agent acts, such as an approval, an answer, or a failure to fix; In progress otherwise. A task with one done thread and another still moving is In progress.
- One bullet per task: the task name in bold, one sentence on where it stands overall, then the titles of the threads it drew on in italics, like _(Fix login redirect; SSO callback tests)_. Under it, at most three one-sentence sub-bullets for what matters most: what shipped, a decision, or what is left.
- For blocked tasks, say what stopped them and what would unblock them.
- State only what the thread contents support. Say it is unclear rather than guess, and never claim work shipped unless a thread shows it.
- Do not invent links, ids, or numbers. Never include email addresses, phone numbers, or other personal data from the threads.
- Before answering, check that every thread title below appears in exactly one task's italic list.
